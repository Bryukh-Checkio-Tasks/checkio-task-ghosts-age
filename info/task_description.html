    Nicola takes a moment to examine the ghosts. He is trying to think up a new method the determination just how old these ghosts are.
    He knows that age is related to their opacity. To the measure their opacity Nikola uses a scale of 10000 units to 0 units,
    where 10000 is a completely opaque newborn ghost (0 years in age) and 0 is completely transparent ghost (of an unknown age).
</p>


<p>
    After some experimenting, Nikola discovered thinks he has discovered the law of ghostly opacity.
    On every birthday, a ghosts opacity is reduced by a number of units equal to its age
    when its age is a Fibonacci number (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Read about this here</a>)
    or increased by 1 if it is not.
</p>
<p>
    For example:<br>
    A newborn ghost -- 10000 units of opacity.<br>
    1 year -- 10000 - 1 = 9999 (1 is a Fibonacci number).<br>
    2 year -- 9999 - 2 = 9997 (2 is a Fibonacci number).<br>
    3 year -- 9997 - 3 = 9994 (3 is a Fibonacci number).<br>
    4 year -- 9994 + 1 = 9995 (4 is not a Fibonacci number).<br>
    5 year -- 9995 - 5 = 9990 (1 is the Fibonacci number).<br>
</p>

    You should help Nicola to write a function which will determination the age of a ghost based on its opacity.
    You are given opacity measurements as a number ranging from 0 to 10000 inclusively.
    The ghosts cannot older than 5000 years as they simply disappear after such a long time.
