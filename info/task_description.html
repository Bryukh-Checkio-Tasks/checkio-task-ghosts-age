    Nicola examines ghosts. He is trying to think up the new method for determination of ghosts age.
    He knows that age is related with opacity. For the measuring of opacity Nikola use the scale from 10000 units to 0,
    where 10000 is a non-transparent newborn ghost (0 years age) and 0 is invisible ghost (age is unknown).
</p>


<p>
    After some experiments Nikola discovered Ðµhe law of change of opacity.
    In every birthday opacity is reduced by the number of units equal to the age
    when this number is a Fibonacci number or increased by 1 if not.
</p>
<p>
    For example:<br>
    A newborn ghost -- 10000 units of opacity.<br>
    1 year -- 10000 - 1 = 9999 (1 is a Fibonacci number).<br>
    2 year -- 9999 - 2 = 9997 (2 is a Fibonacci number).<br>
    3 year -- 9997 - 3 = 9994 (3 is a Fibonacci number).<br>
    4 year -- 9994 + 1 = 9995 (4 is not a Fibonacci number).<br>
    5 year -- 9995 - 5 = 9990 (1 is the Fibonacci number).<br>
</p>


<p>
    You should help Nicola to write a function for determination of ghosts age.
    You are given an opacity measurement as an number (from 0 to 10000 inclusively).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>But this is a Halloween task and you should write a "magic" or "scary" solution. Please, don not write "regular" solution.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> An opacity measurement, an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The ghosts age, an integer.
